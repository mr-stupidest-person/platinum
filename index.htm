    <h1>Platinum</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Platinum is a chemical element with the symbol Pt and atomic number 78. 
        It is a dense, malleable, ductile, highly unreactive, precious, 
        silverish-white transition metal. Its name originates from Spanish platina, a 
        diminutive of plata "silver".
    </p>
    <p>
        Platinum is a member of the platinum group of elements and group 10 of the periodic table of 
        elements. It has six naturally occurring isotopes. It is one of the rarer elements 
        in Earth's crust, with an average abundance of approximately 5 Î¼g/kg. 
        It occurs in some nickel and copper ores along with some native deposits, mostly in South Africa, 
        which accounts for 80% of the world production. 
        Because of its scarcity in Earth's crust, only a few hundred tonnes are produced annually, 
        and given its important uses, it is highly valuable and is a major precious metal commodity.
    </p>

        Platinum is one of the least reactive metals. It has remarkable resistance to corrosion, 
        even at high temperatures, and is therefore considered a noble metal. Consequently, 
        platinum is often found chemically uncombined as native platinum. Because it occurs naturally 
        in the alluvial sands of various rivers, it was first used by pre-Columbian South American natives to 
        produce artifacts. It was referenced in European writings as early 
        as the 16th century, but it was not until Antonio de Ulloa published 
        a report on a new metal of Colombian origin in 1748 that it began to be investigated by scientists.
    </p>

        Platinum is used in catalytic converters, laboratory equipment, electrical contacts and electrodes, 
        platinum resistance thermometers, dentistry equipment, and jewelry. 
        Platinum is used in the glass industry o manipulate molten glass which does not "wet" platinum. 
        As a heavy metal, it leads to health problems upon exposure to its salts; 
        but due to its corrosion resistance, metallic platinum has not been linked to adverse health effects.
        Compounds containing platinum, such as cisplatin, oxaliplatin and carboplatin, are applied in chemotherapy 
        against certain types of cancer.
    </p>
    <p>
        Pure platinum is currently less expensive than pure gold, having been so continuously since 2015, 
        but has been twice as expensive or more. In early 2021, the value of platinum ranged 
        from US$1,055 to US$1,320 per troy ounce.
